# ScriptCrunch

A text analysis utility that applies combinations of DTE, Dictionary, and Substring text compression to text scripts. Aimed towards retro videogame scripts and supports Atlas scripts.

## Archive Notice

I created ScriptCrunch over a few days back in 2007. It is being archived in Github for preservation purposes and because it is still, to my knowledge, the most comprehensive utility for the intended task.

## Getting Started

See the ScriptCrunch.txt manual and included example .ini files to learn how to configure ScriptCrunch to analyze your script.

## Running

ScriptCrunch is a commandline program and must be ran with your specified configuration .ini as follows:

```ScriptCrunch Config.ini```

## Thanks
